## UniCourt's PACER Extractor Details       
### 1. Job schedule to fetch new cases
#### Daily Extraction Jobs which pulls cases the first time:

## Recommended integration methodology

### Getting PACER cases and Case Source Files
* Hit the get_cases_by_last_updated_date api in order to get the CSV containing the UniCourt case ID
* Using the case ID retrieved from the above step, make request to the get_case_source_file_path to get the case source file


We recommend the members in the collective to fetch data from UniCourt twice a day 
1. Run 1
* Call the API with the last_updated_date request parameter to be the current date
* The preferred extraction timing for this run should be after 10:00 AM UTC. This is the time that we expect our extractors to have finished fetching all the cases for the day.

2. Run 2
* Call the API with the last_updated_date request parameter to be the previous date
* The preferred extraction timing for this run should be after 00:15 AM UTC. This run should give you all the cases that were updated for the previous date.
