## UniCourt Extractors
* ##### An extractor (fetches 4 days of cases) that starts at 5:00 AM UTC and hits completion at 8:30 AM UTC, but can go up to 9:30 AM UTC depending on the number of cases
 * ##### Another negate 60 extractor which runs at 7:00AM UTC and fetches cases 60 days prior to the current date. 

## Recommended API Integration method

##### For getting all the cases with the latest updates, the recommended extraction approach is for a two day extraction setup as follows
* ##### Same day run
    * For this setup the last updated date will be the current date
    * The preferred extraction timing for this setup is after 10:00 AM UTC
* ##### Negate Run
    * The run will have the last updated date as the previous days date
    * The preferred timing for this extraction 00:15AM UTC, the next day

##### The above setup is preferred as
* ##### For the same day extraction
     ###### Our daily run which updated the PACER cases hits completion at 9:30AM UTC
* ##### For the negate extraction
    ###### Once the cases are updated by the daily run, there are chances that more cases will be updated by our clients, in this case the negate extractor setup will ensure that even these updated cases are picked.
